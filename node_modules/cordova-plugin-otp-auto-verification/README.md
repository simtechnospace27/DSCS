##### delimiter :
This is matching text just before the OTP string.
Suppose your OTP sms is like "One time password for App is 1234"
then your delimiter will be "App is".

##### length : 
This is length of you OTP string. when otp sms received code will extract this length digits after `delimeter` string.

##### origin :
This is 6 digit senderID which your getting in SMS.
eg. if your getting SMS from senderID TD-ABCDEF then origin = "ABCDEF"

##### NOTE: Sender ID should be fixed one to work Auto OTP verification.
